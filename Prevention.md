# üõ°Ô∏è Prevention: Best Practices for Extension Safety

To stay safe, follow these guidelines:

1. **Install Only from Official Stores**
   - Use Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Edge Add-ons.
   - Avoid third-party download sites.

2. **Check Reviews & Ratings**
   - Read reviews and check star ratings before installing.
   - Avoid extensions with little to no user feedback.

3. **Verify the Publisher**
   - Prefer well-known or open-source developers.
   - Avoid unknown or suspicious publishers.

4. **Review Permissions**
   - Be cautious if an extension requests full access to all websites.
   - Only grant necessary permissions.

5. **Keep Extensions to a Minimum**
   - Fewer extensions = smaller attack surface.
   - Regularly audit and remove unused ones.

6. **Update Regularly**
   - Keep browser and extensions updated.
   - Updates often include important security fixes.

7. **Use Security Tools**
   - Use trusted antivirus/antimalware software.
